                 <p>Rolls-Royce Limited was a British luxury car and later an aero-engine manufacturing business established in 1904 in Manchester by the partnership of Charles Rolls and Henry Royce.
                    Building on Royce's good reputation established with his cranes, they quickly developed a reputation for superior engineering by manufacturing the "best car in the world". 
                    The business was incorporated as "Rolls-Royce Limited" in 1906, and a new factory in Derby was opened in 1908. 
                    The First World War brought the company into manufacturing aero-engines. 
                    Joint development of jet engines began in 1940,</p>
