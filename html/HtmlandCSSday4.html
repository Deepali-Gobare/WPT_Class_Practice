        People often ask “When is Earth Day?”. Earth Day is celebrated annually
        on April 22nd and marks a pivotal moment in the modern environmental
        movement. The day originated in 1970, inspired by the 1969 Santa Barbara
        oil spill when former Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson called for a
        nationwide environmental teach-in. The first Earth Day brought 20
        million Americans together from all walks of life to encourage a
        sustainable environment. They set the scene for what would later be a
        major mobilization and environmental awareness of public opinion in the
        country toward environmental issues. Today, you may ask “What countries
        celebrate Earth Day?”. Earth Day has become one of the major events on
        the planet, celebrated as a "global event" by one billion people from
        hundreds of countries.
